# Holidays Survey

![Holidays Survey mockup](/assets/readme-files/main-image.png)

This python project generates a survey (a holiday survey by default) and then displays the results by applying filters based on the age group and gender questions.
The most remarkable feature about the project is the ability to configure the entire survey from the linked google sheet, from the title, the introductory messages, the questions and answers, to the goodbye message.

All changes can be done just changing linked cells in the google sheet.
